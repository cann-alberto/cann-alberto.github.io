# XR for training emergency medical personnel in invasive procedures
This thesis will be developed in collaboration with Mauriziano Hospital / Università di Torino and will focus on the use of XR technologies in healthcare education and training. More specifically, in their clinical practice, emergency doctors often need to perform invasive procedures.
Among these, one of the most complex is the placement of a central venous catheter in a large-caliber vein (jugular, subclavian, femoral). The procedure involves several steps, some of which are performed under ultrasound guidance. Specifically, the doctor must identify the vessel to be punctured using ultrasound and manage the ultrasound probe with one hand while using the dominant hand to puncture the vessel. Another procedure presenting similar challenges is thoracentesis, a medical procedure performed to remove fluid or air from the pleural space (i.e., the thin gap between the lungs and the chest wall). Similarly, paracentesis is a medical procedure in which a needle or catheter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity to obtain ascitic fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.


# Using eXtended Reality to support the cinema industry</p>
Extended Reality (XR) technologies, encompassing both Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), are disrupting the way films are produced and viewed. Although these technologies are becoming commonplace, they are presenting new, unexplored challenges to both the actors and final viewers. For instance, when motion capture is used to record actors’ movements with the aim of animating digital characters, an increase in the workload is observed for people on stage as they have to rely largely on their imagination to understand how the digitally created characters will behave in the scene. Another research direction regards the effects of innovative cinematic techniques on the viewers' experience. For instance, a key step for immersive movies would be the selection of ideal points of view that would provide the viewer with the best user experience when watching an immersive movie.
In this field, several theses are available. One of the main goals is to deepen existing studies in the context of cinematic AR/VR by conducting more in-depth analyses aimed at offering immersive contents more suitable to the viewers' expectations. For instance, the effects of immersive audio and lighting, as well as the posture adopted by the viewers during the experience, could be studied. Another possibility regards the improvements of an AR system designed to support the actors while rehearsing scenes containing visual effects. Specifically, new solutions are required to cope with limitations due to the combination of MoCap and AR (e.g., for correcting the point of view of the controlled character).

# eXtended Reality technologies for Computer Animation
<p> <b>Description:</b> Generating computer animations, particularly of virtual characters, is a very labor-intensive task, which requires animators to operate with sophisticated interfaces. Hence, researchers continuously experiment with alternative interaction paradigms that could possibly ease the above task. Among others, the use of XR represents a valid alternative to traditional interfaces (based on mouse and keyboard) since it can make interactions more expressive and intuitive. However, although the literature proposes several solutions leveraging XR to solve different computer graphics challenges, generally, these solutions are not fully integrated into the computer animation pipeline or were not designed to support collaborative working.

The objective of this thesis proposal is to design and develop tools integrated in Blender that allow animators to produce and edit 3D character animations, possibly considering alternative interfaces. The thesis could envisage scenarios that combine VR and AR to foster collaboration among the animators.
