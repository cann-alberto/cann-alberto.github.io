I received the M.Sc. and the Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2015 and 2020, respectively. Currently, I am serving as a Fixed-term assistant professor at the Department of Control and Computer Engineering (DAUIN) of Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 
My fields of interest include computer graphics, virtual reality, digital humans, and human-machine interaction.
